## 🎁 Pricing Psychology

**Why $29/month works:**
- Comparable to Netflix, Spotify (familiar price point)
- Less than one sponsored post for most creators
- Clear ROI: One collaboration > $29 value
- Anchored against agency fees ($500-2K/month)

**Free tier strategy:**
- 5 matches/month = enough to see value
- Not enough to replace paid tier
- Acts as extended trial
- Creates upgrade pressure after first successful collab

2. **Quality Over Quantity:** Better to have 1,000 engaged users than 10,000 inactive
3. **Success Stories:** Nothing sells like proof it works
4. **Fast Matching:** Users should find matches within minutes
5. **Trust & Safety:** Verify accounts, moderate behavior
6. **Continuous Value:** New matches weekly, not just one-time
7. **Viral Mechanics:** Invite friends for bonus matches
